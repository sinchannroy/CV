            Having a business name does not separate the business entity from the owner, 
            which means that the owner of the business is responsible and liable for debts incurred by the business. 
            If the business acquires debts, the creditors can go after the owner's personal possessions.A business 
            structure does not allow for corporate tax rates. The proprietor is personally taxed on all income from 
            the business.
